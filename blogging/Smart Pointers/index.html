                        <center><h1>Smart Pointer in C++</h1></center>
<h2>Smart pointer overview</h2>
<p>Since C++11, the standard library includes&nbsp;smart pointers, which help to ensure that programs are free of memory leaks while also remaining exception-safe. With smart pointers, resource acquisition occurs at the same time that the object is initialized (when instantiated with make_shared or make_unique), so that all resources for the object are created and initialized in a single line of code.</p>
<p>In modern C++, raw pointers managed with new and delete should only be used in small blocks of code with limited scope, where performance is critical (such as with placement new) and ownership rights of the memory resource are clear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>C++11 has introduced three types of smart pointers, which are defined in the header of the standard library:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>The&nbsp;unique pointer&nbsp;std::unique_ptr is a smart pointer which exclusively owns a dynamically allocated resource on the heap. There must not be a second unique pointer to the same resource.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The&nbsp;shared pointer&nbsp;std::shared_ptr points to a heap resource but does not explicitly own it. There may even be several shared pointers to the same resource, each of which will increase an internal reference count. As soon as this count reaches zero, the resource will automatically be deallocated.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The&nbsp;weak pointer&nbsp;std::weak_ptr behaves similarly to the shared pointer but does not increase the reference counter.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Prior to C++11, there was a concept called std::auto_ptr, which tried to realize a similar idea. However, this concept can now be safely considered as deprecated and should not be used anymore.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>The Unique pointer</h2>
<p>A unique pointer is the exclusive owner of the memory resource it represents. There must not be a second unique pointer to the same memory resource, otherwise there will be a compiler error. As soon as the unique pointer goes out of scope, the memory resource is deallocated again. Unique pointers are useful when working with a temporary heap resource that is no longer needed once it goes out of scope.</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates the basic idea of a unique pointer:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VuoTin1usgL-hOeH58AuaHqY0HrECiZaPL_vOt3O3EOgIBJ--vg3dGzpUpHKlx4tR-DIQZPVWvyHWtHfChKNr-uccu-P9HTZlWX-WMd8-9MYcz95zlMHSeIQJpGOkWI48TV28N9GHNgJncJ3yap1wnE" width="624" height="440"></p>
<p>In the example, a resource in memory is referenced by a unique pointer instance sourcePtr. Then, the resource is reassigned to another unique pointer instance destPtr using std::move. The resource is now owned by destPtr while sourcePtr can still be used but does not manage a resource anymore.</p>
<p>A unique pointer is constructed using the following syntax:</p>
<p>std::unique_ptr&lt;Type&gt; p(new Type);</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>The Shared Pointer</h2>
<p>Just as the unique pointer, a shared pointer owns the resource it points to. The main difference between the two smart pointers is that shared pointers keep a reference counter on how many of them point to the same memory resource. Each time a shared pointer goes out of scope, the counter is decreased. When it reaches zero (i.e. when the last shared pointer to the resource is about to vanish). the memory is properly deallocated. This smart pointer type is useful for cases where you require access to a memory location on the heap in multiple parts of your program and you want to make sure that whoever owns a shared pointer to the memory can rely on the fact that it will be accessible throughout the lifetime of that pointer.</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates the basic idea of a shared pointer:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SUd3g6JHlxoc4AxhGbh6PrQjax46RAaUrDYA1IMW4ASvtslVwRYoRxuOrjCB1hOM5nokD8CTNEj3Ha8mRU95j8B85HXqiPFAfm5krYWx8PanFx0ZlkZw-GI_eReRG3Oj4NRfcL8e65g1AxDlsdS3kvA" width="624" height="448"></p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>The Weak Pointer</h2>
<p>Similar to shared pointers, there can be multiple weak pointers to the same resource. The main difference though is that weak pointers do not increase the reference count. Weak pointers hold a non-owning reference to an object that is managed by another shared pointer.</p>
<p>The following rule applies to weak pointers: You can only create weak pointers out of shared pointers or out of another weak pointer.</p>
<h2>When to use raw pointers and smart pointers?</h2>
<p>As a general rule of thumb with modern C++, smart pointers should be used often. They will make your code safer as you no longer need to think (much) about the proper allocation and deallocation of memory. As a consequence, there will be much fewer memory leaks caused by dangling pointers or crashes from accessing invalidated memory blocks.</p>
<p>When using raw pointers on the other hand, your code might be susceptible to the following bugs:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Memory leaks</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Freeing memory that shouldn&rsquo;t be freed</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Freeing memory incorrectly</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Using memory that has not yet been allocated</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Thinking that memory is still allocated after being freed</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>With all the advantages of smart pointers in modern C++, one could easily assume that it would be best to completely ban the use of new and delete from your code. However, while this is in many cases possible, it is not always advisable as well. Let us take a look at the&nbsp;<a href="http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#main">C++ core guidelines</a>, which has several&nbsp;<a href="http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#r-resource-management">rules for explicit memory allocation and deallocation</a>. In the scope of this course, we will briefly discuss three of them:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>R. 10: Avoid malloc and free&nbsp;While the calls (MyClass*)malloc( sizeof(MyClass) ) and new MyClass both allocate a block of memory on the heap in a perfectly valid manner, only new will also call the constructor of the class and free the destructor. To reduce the risk of undefined behavior, malloc and free should thus be avoided.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>R. 11: Avoid calling new and delete explicitly&nbsp;Programmers have to make sure that every call of new is paired with the appropriate delete at the correct position so that no memory leak or invalid memory access occurs. The emphasis here lies in the word &quot;explicitly&quot; as opposed to implicitly, such as with smart pointers or containers in the standard template library.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>R. 12: Immediately give the result of an explicit resource allocation to a manager object&nbsp;It is recommended to make use of manager objects for controlling resources such as files, memory or network connections to mitigate the risk of memory leaks. This is the core idea of smart pointers as discussed at length in this section.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Summarizing, raw pointers created with new and delete allow for a high degree of flexibility and control over the managed memory as we have seen in earlier lessons of this course. To mitigate their proneness to errors, the following additional recommendations can be given:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>A call to new should not be located too far away from the corresponding delete. It is bad style to stretch new / delete pairs throughout your program with references criss-crossing your entire code.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Calls to new and delete should always be hidden from third parties so that they must not concern themselves with managing memory manually (which is similar to R. 12).</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above recommendations, the C++ core guidelines also contain a total of 13 rules for the&nbsp;<a href="http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#rsmart-smart-pointers">recommended use of smart pointers</a>. In the following, we will discuss a selection of these:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>R. 20 : Use unique_ptr or shared_ptr to represent ownership</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>R. 21 : Prefer unique_ptr over std::shared_ptr unless you need to share ownership</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Both pointer types express ownership and responsibilities (R. 20). A unique_ptr is an exclusive owner of the managed resource; therefore, it cannot be copied, only moved. In contrast, a shared_ptr shares the managed resource with others. As described above, this mechanism works by incrementing and decrementing a common reference counter. The resulting administration overhead makes shared_ptr more expensive than unique_ptr. For this reason unique_ptr should always be the first choice (R. 21).</p>
<ol start="4">
    <li>
        <p>R. 22 : Use make_shared() to make shared_ptr</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>R. 23 : Use make_unique() to make std::unique_ptr</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>The increased management overhead compared to raw pointers becomes in particular true if a shared_ptr is used. Creating a shared_ptr requires (1) the allocation of the resource using new and (2) the allocation and management of the reference counter. Using the factory function make_shared is a one-step operation with lower overhead and should thus always be preferred. (R.22). This also holds for unique_ptr (R.23), although the performance gain in this case is minimal (if existent at all).</p>
<p>But there is an additional reason for using the make_... factory functions: Creating a smart pointer in a single step removes the risk of a memory leak. Imagine a scenario where an exception happens in the constructor of the resource. In such a case, the object would not be handled properly and its destructor would never be called - even if the managing object goes out of scope. Therefore, make_shared and make_unique should always be preferred. Note that make_unique is only available with compilers that support at least the C++14 standard.</p>
<ol start="3">
    <li>
        <p>R. 24 : Use weak_ptr to break cycles of shared_ptr</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>We have seen that weak pointers provide a way to break a deadlock caused by two owning references which are cyclically referring to each other. With weak pointers, a resource can be safely deallocated as the reference counter is not increased.</p>
